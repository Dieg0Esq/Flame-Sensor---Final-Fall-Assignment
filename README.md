## 📘 Description
The **Keyestudio Flame Sensor** is designed to detect infrared (IR) light that is emitted from the flames.
It's sensitive to light wavelengths between **760 nm and 1100 nm**, allowing it to identify fire.
When a flame is present, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, which can then trigger optional actions like alarms, LEDs, or on-screen alerts.
